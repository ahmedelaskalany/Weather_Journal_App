## Overview

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.
